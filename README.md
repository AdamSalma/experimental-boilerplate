# Experimental Boilerplate
A (hopefully) simple desktop app boilerplate using Node-Webkit, Angular2, Express and SASS. Compiled with Gulp and bundled with Webpack.

## TODO:
- ~~Folder structure~~
- Hello world with Angular.
- ~~Hello world with Express.~~
- ~~Add Node-Webkit.~~
- ~~Hello world with Node-Webkit + Express~~
- ~~Bundle with Webpack.~~

### NOTE:
By default the compile output folder is: ./builds/development.
This is also where express will look to render index.html
