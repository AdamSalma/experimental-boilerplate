A simple boilerplate for Angular2, TypeScript, Node-Webkit, Express and SASS. Bundled with Webpack.

## TODO:
- ~~Folder structure~~
- Hello world with Angular.
- ~~Hello world with Express.~~
- Add Node-Webkit.

### NOTE:
Compiling creates ./builds/
By default the main folder is builds/development.
